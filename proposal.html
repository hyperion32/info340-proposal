    <h2>Problem & Data Domain</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            College students across the nation, including at UW, face the problem of registering for classes multiple
            times a year. Registering for classes is an incredibly stressful and taxing process
            as it requires you to balance the difficulty of your course load with outside commitments. On top of this,
            you may have to take certain classes to meet major requirements or to apply to
            one of UW's many competitive majors. This process requires an immense amount of time finding the perfect
            schedule to meet your needs. If there was a tool that you could use to view other
            students' course map they followed to get to where they are at now; including their experiences with specific professors, their
            final grade, and review of the class--it would make the process of registering for
            classes and creating a course map much easier for others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, there are solutions like <a href="https://myplan.uw.edu">MyPlan</a> that allow you to create
            your course road map for the duration of your college career, but there is no solution that allows you to
            compare your path to another students' path. Current solutions lack this comparison feature on multiple
            fronts including;
            grades, professors, personal anecdotes, major, and career paths. A tool that
            provides these features will benefit students greatly. Before most registration periods, there have been
            multiple threads on Reddit asking <a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/f4xpae/good_spring_quarter_schedule">how difficult</a>
            particular schedules are. A tool that contains all this information, and more, will streamline the process
            of creating course schedules based on students' desires and needs.

    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            Breaking this application down further, I envision the users of the application to be college students who
            are registering for classes or planning their college course map. Students
            may be at different points in their course planning process, but they all would have the same over-arching
            goal which is to create a course map based on other students' experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The users of the application will be viewing information about classes at their desired University. For
            scope purposes, we will only focus on classes at UW but intend to expand
            the application to colleges across the nation. The application will use data compiled from its users. The
            goal is for students to enter their previous courses and course maps
            with information about the professor, difficulty, and personal anecdotes about the class. Therefore, we will
            not be including outside data sources. Application data will be
            organically created.

        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Students enter their previous courses through a form and then will be stored in our database.</li>
            <img src="img/IMG_0036.jpg" alt="user submitting classes">
            <li>Students can browse through the application, filtering results based on a myriad of filters
                (major, career track, college, professor, class).</li>
            <img src="img/IMG_0037.jpg" alt="user filtering through a search">
            <li>Students can add classes to their plan and build out a course map based on the information they find.

            This app will help solve my chosen problem because it will be the main source that students can use
            to
            view information about the classes at their respective University. It will
            allow students to make informed decisions about their course map which is incredibly important to
            follow
            if you attend competitive schools like UW. It will eliminate having to
            take to Reddit and other sources to learn about the difficulty of your course load. With this
            application, you will be able to spend more time focusing on things other than
            stressing about course trajectory. Leave the hard work to us.
